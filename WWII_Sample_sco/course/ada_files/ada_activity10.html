<p>Question:</p><p>Was WWII one big war or two separate wars?</p><p>Answer:</p><p>WWII was in a real sense two separate wars going on at the same time. The European conflict saw the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, the United States, and some of the smaller countries fighting against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The Pacific war saw the United States and Great Britain (and her Indian and Australian allies) fighting against the Japanese and Chinese. The Soviet Union was never involved in the Pacific war, and Japan was not at all involved in European war. The two wars started separately and ended separately.</p>
